## Rolling Mechanics

- **Standard Roll**: Players roll a `d100` and aim to roll under their skill score.
- **Modifiers**: GM can apply modifiers based on difficulty or circumstances.

### Critical Outcomes

- **Critical Success**: Doubles below the required roll.
- **Critical Failure**: Doubles over the required roll.

### Special Scenarios

- **Below 1 Requirement**:
    - Player must roll a 1 for success.
    - Any doubles count as a success, but not a critical.
  
- **Above 100 Requirement**:
    - Player must roll 99 or lower for success.
    - Any doubles count as a failure.


## Combat

### Health Points

- **Most Professions**: 40 HP
- **Martial Professions**: 50 HP
- **Skill Increment**: Every increment to a tens (e.g. martial skill of 19 -> 20) grants 1d10 HP.

---

### Damage

- **1-handed weapons**: `1d10 + tens digit of martial skill.`
- **2-handed weapons**: `1d12 + tens digit of martial skill.` 
    - Note: These weapons tend to give bigger + bonuses.

---

### Critical Strike

In combat, if a player rolls doubles below their required skill check (e.g., if the required check is 60, rolling 11, 22, 33, or 44), they land a critical hit. This exceptional feat results in the damage being tripled.

For 1-handed weapons, the critical hit damage formula becomes:

- `1d10 + (tens of martial skill * 3)`

---

## Armor

- **Function**: Modifies the attacker’s skill check.
- **Example**: Leather armor gives a `-10` modifier to an attacker’s martial skill.

| **Blurred Vision**      | Perception     | Due to an old injury or ailment, the character's vision is never quite clear. Spotting small details becomes a challenge.       |
