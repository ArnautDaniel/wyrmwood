## Setting

    A grimdark, parallel to medieval Europe where magic is extremely rare.

## Character Creation

#### Base Stats

    Every player starts with a 30/100 in all skills.

#### Skills
Players use these to determine success in various tasks.

    Martial:
        This skill represents a character's proficiency in hand-to-hand combat,
        with weapons, and overall battlefield tactics. A high martial skill means
        the character is a seasoned warrior, adept at fighting and understanding the
        intricacies of warfare.

    Social:
        This skill pertains to a character's ability to communicate, persuade,
        intimidate, and otherwise interact with other characters. It reflects charisma,
        eloquence, and the knowledge of etiquette and cultural norms.

    Knowledge:
        A character's breadth and depth of accumulated information about the world,
        its history, mysteries, and workings. This skill is essential for scholars,
        researchers, and those who rely on lore and ancient texts.

    Survival:
        Survival skill covers a character's ability to find food and water, build shelter,
        navigate, track, and generally thrive in wilderness settings. It's essential for 
        those who spend time outside of civilization.

    Craftsmanship:
        This skill indicates proficiency in creating, repairing, and understanding objects
        and mechanisms. From blacksmithing to tailoring to carpentry, this skill covers all
        manners of crafting disciplines.

    Perception:
        Perception encompasses a character's awareness of their surroundings. This includes
        noticing hidden objects, detecting lies, spotting ambushes, or observing tiny details
        that others might miss.

    Stealth:
        This skill denotes a character's ability to move quietly, hide effectively, and 
        generally avoid detection. It's the mainstay of thieves, spies, and assassins.

    Leadership:
        Leadership skill represents a character's proficiency in inspiring, commanding,
        and strategizing with groups of people. It's essential for commanders, chiefs,
        and others in positions of authority.

    Arcane:
        This elusive skill governs the understanding and harnessing of magical forces.
        Characters with this skill can cast spells, decipher arcane texts, and understand
        magical phenomena. However, it's rare and always starts at 0, indicating that innate
        magical ability is non-existent at the start, and any prowess in this area must be learned over time.


## Commoner Professions

    Farmer - Survival + Craftsmanship
        "Bountiful Harvest": Once per session, a Farmer can find or procure food and water
        sufficient to sustain themselves and up to five companions for a day, even in barren lands.

    Merchant - Social + Knowledge
        "Shrewd Bargainer": Once per session, the Merchant can negotiate a favorable deal,

    Beggar - Survival + Stealth
        "Unseen Presence": Once per session, the Beggar can blend into a crowd or environment
        so effectively that they become virtually invisible, allowing them to bypass guards

    Minstrel - Social + Stealth
        "Captivating Performance": Once per session, a Minstrel can play a tune or tell a

        favor in a social setting.

    Herbalist - Knowledge + Survival
        "Nature's Remedy": Once per session, the Herbalist can craft a potion or salve from
        available herbs that can heal minor wounds, neutralize poisons, or offer protection
        against natural elements for a day.

    Miller/Baker - Craftsmanship + Social
        "Heartwarming Loaf": Once per session, the Miller/Baker can produce food that not 
        only nourishes but also boosts the morale of those who consume it, granting a +10 
        on their next roll.

    Fisherman - Survival + Perception
        "Keen Angler": Once per session, the Fisherman can ensure a bountiful catch or spot 
        something valuable in the water, be it a precious artifact or a hint of a hidden 
        underwater passage.

    Cobbler - Craftsmanship + Stealth
        "Silent Soles": Once per session, the Cobbler can craft or modify footwear that grants 
        the wearer near-silent movement, providing a +20 bonus to Stealth checks for a short 
        duration. 


## Skill Checks

    Players roll a d100 and aim to roll under their skill score.
    GM can apply modifiers based on difficulty or circumstances.
    Critical Success: Doubles below the required roll.
    Critical Failure: Doubles over the required roll.
    Special Scenarios:
        If the required roll is below 1: Player must roll a 1 for success. Any doubles count 
        as a success, but not a critical.
        If the required roll is above 100: Player must roll 99 or lower for success. 
        Any doubles count as a failure.

## Combat

#### Health Points

    Most Professions: 40 HP
    Martial Professions: 50 HP
    Every increment to a tens (i.e. martial skill of 19 -> 20) grants 1d10 HP.

#### Damage

    1-handed weapons: 1d10 + tens digit of martial skill.
    2-handed weapons: 1d12 + tens digit of martial skill. (These weapons tend to give bigger + bonuses)

#### Critical Strike
In combat, if a player rolls doubles below their required skill check (e.g., if the required check is 60, rolling 11, 22, 33, or 44), they land a critical hit. This exceptional feat results in the damage being tripled.

For 1-handed weapons, the damage formula on a critical hit becomes:

    1d10 + (tens of martial skill * 3)

## Armor

    Modifies the attacker’s skill check (e.g., leather armor = -10 to an attacker’s martial skill).

## Baneful Histories (skill cannot be progressed beyond 40/100):

    Blurred Vision
        Affected Skill: Perception
        Description: Due to an old injury or ailment, the character's
        vision is never quite clear. Spotting small details becomes a challenge.

    Cursed Tongue
        Affected Skill: Social
        Description: An old witch's curse or perhaps a traumatic event has
        left the character with a stutter or difficulty in expressing themselves effectively.

    Fractured Memory
        Affected Skill: Knowledge
        Description: A blow to the head or a psychological trauma has caused 
        the character to have gaps in their memory, making recalling facts difficult.

    Hobbled Leg
        Affected Skill: Stealth
        Description: An old wound or birth defect causes the character to walk with
        a limp, making it challenging to move silently.

    Frail Physique
        Affected Skill: Martial
        Description: Due to malnourishment or a debilitating disease in their youth,
        the character has a weaker physical stature.

    Nature's Scorn
        Affected Skill: Survival
        Description: For reasons unknown, animals act aggressively and nature seems 
        to turn against the character. This might be due to a curse, a past misdeed against nature, or simply bad luck.

    Shaky Hands
        Affected Skill: Craftsmanship
        Description: Whether from age, nerves, or an accident, the character's hands
        tremble, making delicate tasks difficult.

    Doubtful Spirit
        Affected Skill: Leadership
        Description: Perhaps due to past failures or inherent insecurity, the character
        struggles with self-doubt, making it hard to lead or inspire others.

    Magic's Blind Spot
        Affected Skill: Arcane
        Description: The character has a peculiar resistance or blindness to magic.
        While this might sometimes be a boon, it mostly makes understanding and wielding magic a challenge.
