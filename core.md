        only nourishes but also boosts the morale of those who consume it, granting a +10 
        on their next roll.

    Fisherman - Survival + Perception
        "Keen Angler": Once per session, the Fisherman can ensure a bountiful catch or spot

-------------
Skill Checks:

    Players roll a d100 and aim to roll under their skill score.
    GM can apply modifiers based on difficulty or circumstances.
    Critical Success: Doubles below the required roll.
    Critical Failure: Doubles over the required roll.
    Special Scenarios:
        If the required roll is below 1: Player must roll a 1 for success. Any doubles count as a success, but not a critical.
        If the required roll is above 100: Player must roll 99 or lower for success. Any doubles count as a failure.


-----------
Combat:

Health Points:

    Most characters: 40 HP
    Knights: 50 HP

Damage:

    1-handed weapons: 1d10 + tens digit of martial skill.
    2-handed weapons: 1d12 + tens digit of martial skill.

Critical Strike:
In combat, if a player rolls doubles below their required skill check (e.g., if the required check is 60, rolling 11, 22, 33, or 44), they land a critical hit. This exceptional feat results in the damage being tripled.

For 1-handed weapons, the damage formula on a critical hit becomes:

    1d10 + (tens of martial skill * 3)

------------
Armor:

    Modifies the attacker’s skill check (e.g., leather armor = -10 to an attacker’s martial skill).
