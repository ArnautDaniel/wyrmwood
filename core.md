Setting:

    A grimdark, parallel to medieval Europe where magic is extremely rare.

Character Creation:

Base Stats:

    Every player starts with a 30/100 in all skills.

Skills:
Players use these to determine success in various tasks.

    Martial:
        This skill represents a character's proficiency in hand-to-hand combat,
        with weapons, and overall battlefield tactics. A high martial skill means
        the character is a seasoned warrior, adept at fighting and understanding the
        intricacies of warfare.

    Social:
        This skill pertains to a character's ability to communicate, persuade,
        intimidate, and otherwise interact with other characters. It reflects charisma,
        eloquence, and the knowledge of etiquette and cultural norms.

    Knowledge:
        A character's breadth and depth of accumulated information about the world,
        its history, mysteries, and workings. This skill is essential for scholars,
        researchers, and those who rely on lore and ancient texts.

    Survival:
        Survival skill covers a character's ability to find food and water, build shelter,
        navigate, track, and generally thrive in wilderness settings. It's essential for 
        those who spend time outside of civilization.

    Craftsmanship:
        This skill indicates proficiency in creating, repairing, and understanding objects
        and mechanisms. From blacksmithing to tailoring to carpentry, this skill covers all
        manners of crafting disciplines.

    Perception:
        Perception encompasses a character's awareness of their surroundings. This includes
        noticing hidden objects, detecting lies, spotting ambushes, or observing tiny details
        that others might miss.

    Stealth:
        This skill denotes a character's ability to move quietly, hide effectively, and 
        generally avoid detection. It's the mainstay of thieves, spies, and assassins.

    Leadership:
        Leadership skill represents a character's proficiency in inspiring, commanding,
        and strategizing with groups of people. It's essential for commanders, chiefs,
        and others in positions of authority.

    Arcane:
        This elusive skill governs the understanding and harnessing of magical forces.
        Characters with this skill can cast spells, decipher arcane texts, and understand
        magical phenomena. However, it's rare and always starts at 0, indicating that innate
        magical ability is non-existent at the start, and any prowess in this area must be learned over time.

Primary Professions:
These grant a 60/100 to their primary skill.

    Knight - Martial
        "Chivalrous Aura": Once per session, the Knight can call upon their code of honor to
        gain the respect of an NPC, which can result in assistance or avoiding conflict altogether.
        It can also inspire allies, granting them a +10 to their next roll.

    Diplomat - Social
        "Silver Tongue": Once per session, the Diplomat can attempt to convince or persuade an
        individual without rolling, as long as it's within reason and not against the individual's
        core beliefs.

        "Lore Keeper": When confronted with ancient texts, symbols, or historical events,
        the Scholar can recall an obscure fact or detail once per session that can aid in their
        current situation.

    Ranger - Survival
        "Nature's Whisperer": The Ranger can commune with nature to get assistance. This could

        revealing hidden paths once per session.

    Craftsman - Craftsmanship
        "Masterpiece Creation": Once per session, the Craftsman can create an item of exceptional

        an additional turn or action. This can be used to turn the tide of a battle.

        themselves or an ally, be it legal repercussions, a combat scenario, or social faux pas, 
        by invoking their diplomatic status.

        "Divine Guidance": Once per session, a Priest can seek guidance from the heavens. This grants

        a temporary magical or extraordinary property.

    Investigator - Perception + Social
        "Interrogate": Once per session, the Investigator can extract the truth or crucial

        the shadows. This attack is rolled with a +20 bonus and, if successful, deals double damage.

    Strategist - Leadership + Knowledge
        "Battle Tactician": Once during a combat scenario, the Strategist can reposition 
        allies or predict an enemy's move, allowing them to negate one enemy action or 
        provide an ally with an immediate extra action.    Paladin - Martial + Leadership

    Farmer - Survival + Craftsmanship

-------------
Skill Checks:

    Players roll a d100 and aim to roll under their skill score.
    GM can apply modifiers based on difficulty or circumstances.
    Critical Success: Doubles below the required roll.
    Critical Failure: Doubles over the required roll.
    Special Scenarios:
        If the required roll is below 1: Player must roll a 1 for success. Any doubles count 
        as a success, but not a critical.
        If the required roll is above 100: Player must roll 99 or lower for success. 
        Any doubles count as a failure.


-----------
Combat:

Health Points:

    Most Professions: 40 HP
    Martial Professions: 50 HP
    Every increment to a tens (i.e. martial skill of 19 -> 20) grants 1d10 HP.

Damage:

    1-handed weapons: 1d10 + tens digit of martial skill.
    2-handed weapons: 1d12 + tens digit of martial skill. (These weapons tend to give bigger + bonuses)

Critical Strike:
In combat, if a player rolls doubles below their required skill check (e.g., if the required check is 60, rolling 11, 22, 33, or 44), they land a critical hit. This exceptional feat results in the damage being tripled.

For 1-handed weapons, the damage formula on a critical hit becomes:

    1d10 + (tens of martial skill * 3)

------------
Armor:

    Modifies the attacker’s skill check (e.g., leather armor = -10 to an attacker’s martial skill).

-------------
