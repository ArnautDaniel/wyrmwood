### **Background**:
Cedric has seen better days. Once a trader in a bustling town, he lost everything due to a bad deal and treacherous partners. Forced into begging, he learned the importance of stealth and survival. The streets can be tough, and the alleys full of danger. Cedric's vision has always been a bit off, but it worsened after a scuffle in the marketplace. Yet, amidst the hardships, he carries hope in his heart, believing in a better tomorrow.
