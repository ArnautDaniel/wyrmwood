# Magic in Wyrmwood

## Papal Magic

### Core Concept
This form of magic is derived from ancient talismans, relics, and artifacts that are deeply intertwined with the religious history of the world. The power within these items is channeled and controlled by the practitioner.

### Mechanics
- Requires possession of a specific talisman or artifact.
- Each artifact possesses a set number of charges. Once used up, the artifact needs to be consecrated at a holy site to regain its power.
- Some artifacts are general-purpose, while others are very specific in their effects.

### Example Spells
- **Saint's Shield**: Uses a talisman to create a protective barrier around the caster.
- **Chalice's Heal**: By drinking consecrated water from a sacred chalice, one can heal wounds.

## Protestant Magic

### Core Concept
This form of magic is based on the word of the Bible. By reciting specific verses and manifesting their faith, practitioners can perform miracles.

### Mechanics
- Requires knowledge of specific Bible verses.
- The strength of the spell depends on the caster's knowledge skill.
- A deep understanding of the verse in context makes the spell more potent.
- Casting takes longer as it often requires recitation or meditation on the verse.

### Example Spells
- **Lamb's Light**: A verse recited to illuminate dark areas.
- **Jericho's Call**: A loud, sonic wave to disarm and disorient enemies.

## Demonic Magic

### Core Concept
Practiced by cultists and those who have turned their backs on the divine. This form of magic is chaotic, drawing power from the daemons of the world.

### Mechanics
- Requires pacts or agreements with specific daemons. These pacts often come with a cost.
- Casting can sometimes have unpredictable results, especially if the daemon's desires aren't aligned with the caster's.
- Ritualistic in nature, often requiring specific conditions or components.

### Example Spells
- **Shadow Cloak**: Engulf the caster in shadows, making them nearly invisible.
- **Daemon's Whisper**: Sends haunting whispers to a target, sowing confusion and fear.

## Classification

### Divine
Often taught within the church. For Papal magic, one must be entrusted with the artifacts, making it more exclusive. Protestant magic can be practiced by any devout follower who studies the Bible deeply.

### Demonic
Knowledge is passed down through forbidden texts or directly from older cultists to newer members. Sometimes, it's acquired by those who actively seek out daemons in forbidden places.

While Divine magic is widely accepted and seen as a blessing, Demonic magic is shunned and feared. However, the line between them is often blurry, making the morality of magic a constant theme throughout the adventures in Wyrmwood.
